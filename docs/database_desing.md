# Database Design:

# Subjects
1. Relational Database: Create a normalized relational database schema for core transactional data (e.g., orders, customers).
2. NoSQL Database: Decide which parts of the data (such as frequently accessed book details or user session data) could be stored in a NoSQL key-value store (e.g., Redis).
3. Caching Strategy: Identify if and where caching can improve performance in data retrieval (for example, caching book details that donâ€™t change often).
