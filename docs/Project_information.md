# Project Information
## Overview
You will work to design and implement an online bookstore application using a relational database and / or a NoSQL database. Your application should handle data related to books, authors, customers, and orders efficiently. You will make informed design choices about which database technologies to use for different parts of the system and how to handle data caching when appropriate.

## Scenario
You are building an online bookstore that includes:

Books and Authors: Data about available books and their authors.
Customers and Orders: Customer information and order processing.
Inventory Management: Updates to stock levels when orders are placed.
Different parts of your application may have varying requirements for reading and writing data.

For example, book details might be read frequently but updated rarely, whereas inventory levels and orders may need rapid updates. You will decide which database types (relational or NoSQL) are best suited for these different aspects.
