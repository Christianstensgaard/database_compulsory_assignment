# Implementation in C#
### Develop a C# application that:
1. Connects to and interacts with both your relational database and NoSQL data store (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis or MongoDB).


### Handles essential operations such as:
1. Displaying books and authors.
2. Processing new orders (writing to the relational database).
3. Updating inventory levels.
4. Retrieving cached data when appropriate.
